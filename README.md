# ** Fake and True News Classification using NLP Techniques and LSTM **

_This project aims to classify news articles as either fake or true by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, with a specific focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
The model was trained on a labeled dataset, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess its performance._
